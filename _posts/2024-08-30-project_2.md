# Introduction
> Understanding *why* people churn is a normal response; *simply accepting it is not*. 

Competition in today's telecommunications industry is tougher than ever, with the rise of new and improved products and services that can easily sway customers from one provider to another. In such a landscape, even minor lapses in customer satisfaction can lead to significant ***churn***—where customers switch to a competitor, seeking better value, service, or experience.

Churn isn’t just a metric to be monitored; it’s a crucial indicator of underlying issues that, if left unaddressed, can erode a company's market share and profitability. This learning oriented project focuses on two things:
1. **Exploring intricate patterns of customer behavior**  aiming to identify the key drivers of churn.
2. **Proposing strategic solutions** that leverage the insights gained from data analysis to reduce churn, improve customer retention, and ultimately, enhance profitability.

# Data Profiling
The data was sourced from Kaggle, specifically from *IBM's Sample Data Sets*. Although fictional, this dataset serves as an excellent sandbox for showcasing exploratory data analysis (EDA) skills and machine learning modeling. The schema is detailed below:

| Column           | Data Type     | Values                                          |

# Data Quality Assessment
Prior to data transformations, it is **critical** to check the health of our source data. For this, we are to follow the standard ***Data Quality Dimensions***

| Dimension | Code                                                                                                                                          | Assessment                                                                                                                                                                             |

| Uniqueness    | `df.drop_duplicates()`<br>`df.count()`                                                                                                            | - There are no instances of duplicate entries                                                                                                                                              |

# Surface-level EDA: The Basic Facts
This initial exploration is dedicated to gaining a foundational understanding of the customer base. By examining demographic characteristics and fundamental preferences, we aim to know *who* the customers are, their behavior, and what drives their engagement with the service. This analysis sets the stage for deeper dives into more complex relationships and trends within the data.

# Plausible Reasons for Churning

As shown in the last slide, the churn rate among customers is **approaching 30%**, a figure that signals potential issues within the company’s service or customer retention strategies. While the scope of the data covers only the churning from the previous month, it can be highly problematic if not addressed.

Now that we have some idea on the basic facts about *who* the customers are, let’s focus on the possible reasons for their churn... *Why did they churn?*

| Older customers struggle with adapting to new services |  
|---|
| ![](\assets\images\LOP_Telco_senior citizen.png) | Older customers exhibit a higher churn rate of **41%** compared to younger customers. <br><br> The older customer segment is **financially sensitive**, relying on **fixed income or pensions**, which makes them hesitant to invest in new services. Additionally, **adaptability to new technology** can be a barrier due to **limited tech familiarity**.|

|   |  Independence leads to greater flexibility in service usage |
|---|
| Customers who are independent tend to churn at a rate of **33%**, which is higher compared to those with family responsibilities. <br><br> **Dependency** refers to the reliance on a particular service for daily, personal needs or business operations, creating a need for **stability and consistency**. Customers without such dependencies are more **flexible** in choosing services and can more easily perceive and adapt to **subtle differences** between options. | ![](\assets\images\LOP_Telco_dependents.png) | 

| Combined cost may burden finances, causing dissatisfaction |  
|---|
| ![](\assets\images\LOP_Telco_phone X internet.png) | **Thirty-three percent (33%)** of customers who used both internet and phone services have churned. <br><br> Sometimes, **bundling** may not meet the needs or financial capabilities of all customers. In this case, the **average monthly cost** for customers who have churned is **$82.25**, regardless of the additional services they may have had. This can be a potential **financial burden** for those who are economically struggling or living independently.|

|   | Monthly billing can make costs seem higher psychologically
|---| 
| Customers who are in monthly contracts with the service tend to churn more at a rate of **43%** <br><br> - Regular payments may lead customers to **reassess the value** of the service relative to the cost. Over time, the cumulative effect might **amplify the perception of financial burden**, even if the total amount paid annually is comparable to or less than other billing models. | ![](\assets\images\LOP_Telco_monthly bill.png) | 

| Dissatisfaction with the quality of electronic transactions |  
|---|
| ![](\assets\images\LOP_Telco_online pay.png) | Customers who pay online will more likely churn at a rate of **45%** compared to those who use other payment methods. <br><br>  The **lack of support** during downtimes or technical difficulties often leads to **frustration**. Additionally, customers who are more **tech-savvy** and use online payment methods typically have higher expectations for **high-quality digital interactions**. When support does not meet these expectations, it can exacerbate dissatisfaction and contribute to customer churn.|

|   | Fiber optic users experience high churn due to cost expectations
|---|
| Fiber-optic users tend to churn more at a rate of **42%**. <br><br> It is surprising to see that fiber optic users tend to churn more than DSL users, given that fiber optics offer more network advantages. This suggests potential issues with both **pricing** and **service quality**. The **premium cost** of fiber optic services can be a barrier for many customers, especially if they perceive the value to be insufficient. | ![](\assets\images\LOP_Telco_foptics.png) | 

| With internet add-ons, streaming services can drive customers to churn |  
|---|
| ![](\assets\images\LOP_Telco_stream.png) | Generally, among all the possible internet service add-ons, streaming has the highest churn rates. Analysis shows that customers **who only stream movies have a churn rate of 65%**, while those **who only stream TV have a rate of 61%**, and those **who stream both have a rate of 60%**. <br><br> High churn rates in streaming services, whether for **movies** or **TV content**, often stem from the **selection of media**. Customers may find themselves dissatisfied if the content library does not meet their expectations or if it lacks variety and freshness. This can lead to a perception of limited value, prompting users to switch to other services that better align with their viewing preferences.|
