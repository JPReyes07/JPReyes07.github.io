# Introduction
Understanding *why* people churn is a normal response; *simply accepting it is not*. 

Competition in today's telecommunications industry is tougher than ever, with the rise of new and improved products and services that can easily sway customers from one provider to another. In such a landscape, even minor lapses in customer satisfaction can lead to significant ***churn***—where customers switch to a competitor, seeking better value, service, or experience.

Churn isn’t just a metric to be monitored; it’s a crucial indicator of underlying issues that, if left unaddressed, can erode a company's market share and profitability. This learning oriented project focuses on two things:
1. **Exploring intricate patterns of customer behavior**  aiming to identify the key drivers of churn.
2. **Proposing strategic solutions** that leverage the insights gained from data analysis to reduce churn, improve customer retention, and ultimately, enhance profitability.

# Data Profiling
The data was sourced from Kaggle, specifically from *IBM's Sample Data Sets*. Although fictional, this dataset serves as an excellent sandbox for showcasing exploratory data analysis (EDA) skills and machine learning modeling. The schema is detailed below:

# Data Quality Assessment
Prior to data transformations, it is **critical** to check the health of our source data. For this, we are to follow the standard ***Data Quality Dimensions***

| Dimension | Code                                                                                                                                          | Assessment                                                                                                                                                                             |

| Uniqueness    | `df.drop_duplicates()`<br>`df.count()`                                                                                                            | - There are no instances of duplicate entries                                                                                                                                              |

# Data Transformations

Full changes are shown in my notebook: [https://github.com/JPReyes07/Machine-Learning/blob/main/TelecomCustomerChurn-II.ipynb](https://github.com/JPReyes07/Machine-Learning/blob/main/TelecomCustomerChurn-II.ipynb)


# Surface-level EDA: The Basic Facts
This initial exploration is dedicated to gaining a foundational understanding of the customer base. By examining demographic characteristics and fundamental preferences, we aim to know *who* the customers are, their behavior, and what drives their engagement with the service. This analysis sets the stage for deeper dives into more complex relationships and trends within the data.

# Reasons for Churning

As shown in the last slide, the churn rate among customers is **approaching 30%**, a figure that signals potential issues within the company’s service or customer retention strategies. While the scope of the data covers only the churning from the previous month, it can be highly problematic if not addressed. Understanding the reasons behind this churn is crucial for addressing the root causes and implementing effective solutions. 

Now that we have some idea on the basic facts about *who* the customers are, let’s focus on the possible reasons for their churn... *Why did they churn?*

| Older customers struggle with adapting to new services |  
|---|
| ![](\assets\images\LOP_Telco_senior citizen.png) | Analysis reveals that older customers exhibit a higher **churn rate of 41%** compared to the younger customers. Older customers are frequently on fixed incomes or pensions, which makes them more sensitive to changes in service value. Thus, this financial sensitivity, coupled with potential difficulties in adapting to new technologies, contributes to the higher churn rates observed within this age group. |

| Flexibility leads to switching to cost-effective alternatives. |  
|---|
| When a customer has no dependents, they generally have fewer obligations tying them to a specific service. This **means they are more flexible and less committed to a service provider,** as their personal or financial circumstances do not demand the same level of service continuity. As a result, if the service fails to meet their expectations or they find a better-suited alternative, they may be more inclined to switch. On the other hand, customers with dependents typically have a greater need for stability and continuity in their services. **Customers who are independent has a churn rate of 33%** | ![](\assets\images\LOP_Telco_dependents.png) | 

| Combined cost may burden finances, causing dissatisfaction. |  
|---|
| ![](\assets\images\LOP_Telco_phone X internet.png) | Based on the analysis, the average monthly cost for customers who have churned is **$82.25**, which applies to those availing both internet and phone services. This figure highlights a potential financial burden, especially for individuals who may be struggling economically or living independently. Bundling services, while often intended to provide convenience and value, might not always align with the needs and financial capacities of all customers. **Among those who availed both, 33% have churned**|

| Monthly billing can make costs seem higher psychologically. |  
|---|
|Interestingly, the structure of monthly payments can contribute to a perception of higher costs, primarily due to the more frequent billings. Essentially, this is **a psychological effect**. Each payment serves as a reminder of the expense, which may lead customers to re-evaluate the value of the service to the amount they are paying. Over time, the cumulative effect might amplify the perception of financial burden, even if the total amount paid annually is comparable to or less than other billing models. The **churn rate is at 43%** among those who availed monthly contracts.| ![](\assets\images\LOP_Telco_monthly bill.png) | 

| Higher expectations from tech-savvy customers lead to dissatisfaction. |  
|---|
| ![](\assets\images\LOP_Telco_online pay.png) |Also a psychological effect, customers who choose to pay using online or electronic means are often more tech-savvy and **have higher expectations for digital interactions and services**. Among those who pay online, **the churn rate is 45%**. A common issue with this particular channel is **the lack of support during downtimes or technical difficulties**. When customers face issues with online transactions and lack prompt support, they may churn due to frustration and seek competitors with better service.|

| Fiber optic users experience high churn due to cost expectations.|  
|---|
| Fiber optic users exhibit a **churn rate of 42%**. This higher churn rate can be attributed to **the premium cost associated** with fiber optic services. Customers who choose fiber optics often do so with high expectations for superior performance and features. If these expectations are not met—whether through service quality or speed—or if they find more affordable alternatives that meet their needs, they are likely to switch providers.| ![](\assets\images\LOP_Telco_foptics.png) | 

| In terms of internet add-ons, streaming TV and movie services can drive customers to churn |  
|---|
| ![](\assets\images\LOP_Telco_stream.png) | Generally, among all the possible internet service add-ons, streaming has the highest churn rates. Analysis shows that customers **who only stream movies have a churn rate of 65%**, while those **who only stream TV have a rate of 61%**, and those **who stream both have a rate of 60%**. The higher churn rates among customers who stream movies alone could be attributed to the perception that movie streaming services often do not offer as much continuous value. Customers who stream TV might have a higher perceived value due to the broader range of content and regular updates. Finally, those who stream both TV and movies have relatively the lowest churn rate, suggesting that bundling these services provides a more comprehensive entertainment experience.|
